Behold and mark the children of man
What yet they do to your beloved Earth.
How they ravage the mountains and valleys
The fields and the stones
The wooded lands and the wilderness
The bottoms of the seas and the depths of the Earth.
They ransack them all for the love of worldly goods.
And neither rain, wind, thunder, snow, nor all manner of foul weather will stop them.

- Death and the Plowman
